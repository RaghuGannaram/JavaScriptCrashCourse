/*
 * Insertion Sort
 * - It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.
 * - It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 * - It is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the relative order of elements that compare equal.
 * - Insertion sort is used when the number of elements is small.
 * - It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.
 * - Insertion sort is a good choice in online sorting when the list is being built up live, and it is desired that the list is sorted so far with each new element inserted.
 * - It is also useful in the case of online algorithms to sort dynamically changing data.
 * - Insertion sort is used in Hybrid sort which combines different sorting algorithms to improve performance.
 * - Insertion sort is used in Tim sort or smooth sort, algorithms used in sorting elements in real-time applications.
