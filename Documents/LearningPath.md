# ðŸ§  Advanced JavaScript Learning Plan (No Abstractions)

This plan is designed for a deep, no-abstraction dive into JavaScript, exploring both how the language works and how it's evolving.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Language Core & Internals

1. **Execution Contexts & Call Stack**
2. **Scopes & Closures (with internals)**
3. **Hoisting & TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)**
4. **Primitive Types vs Reference Types**
5. **Prototypes & `this` (including `bind`, `call`, `apply`)**
6. **Functions: First-class citizens, higher-order, async**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Advanced Concepts

1. **Event Loop & Microtasks/Macrotasks**
2. **Promises, Async/Await & Generator Functions**
3. **Memory Management & Garbage Collection**
4. **Modules (ESM vs CommonJS)**
5. **Symbols, Iterators, and Generators**
6. **Proxy & Reflect APIs**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Language in Practice

1. **Writing a mini JS engine/interpreter**
2. **Implementing features like `bind`, `map`, or `Promise` manually**
3. **Performance & Optimization (hidden classes, inline caching)**
4. **Understanding Babel/TypeScript compilation output**
5. **Inspecting bytecode with V8 tools**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Ecosystem & Tooling Deep Dive

1. **ESBuild, Vite, Webpack internals**
2. **NPM, package resolution algorithms**
3. **Transpilers and AST (Abstract Syntax Trees)**
4. **Security in JS (CSP, XSS, etc.)**

> âš¡ You're not just learning JavaScriptâ€”youâ€™re reverse-engineering it from the inside out.
