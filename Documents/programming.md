-   **Detailed Explanation**: Data passes through a sequence of stages or operations.
-   **Languages**: Unix Shell, PowerShell

# Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a software engineering design principle that reverses the control flow in comparison to traditional procedural programming.

## Key Concepts

-   **Control Flow**: Traditionally, application code controls the flow of execution. In IoC, this is reversed: a framework or library calls the application code.
-   **Dependency Injection**: A form of IoC where dependencies are provided externally, leading to improved modularity and testability.
-   **Event-Driven Programming**: IoC is often used in event-driven programming, where user-provided functions respond to events and are called by a framework.
-   **Frameworks vs. Libraries**: Frameworks employ IoC, invoking user-defined functions as needed, whereas libraries are called by the application code.

## Examples

-   **GUI Applications**: GUI frameworks run the main loop and call user-provided code in response to user actions.
-   **Spring Framework**: In Java's Spring framework, objects are constructed with dependencies provided by the Spring container.
-   **Web Servers**: Web servers handle HTTP requests and invoke user-defined functions based on URL and method.

## Advantages

-   **Decoupling**: IoC decouples high-level policy from low-level details, enhancing modularity.
-   **Ease of Testing**: It facilitates easier testing of individual components in isolation.
-   **Flexibility and Reusability**: Applications become more flexible, and components more reusable.

## Disadvantages

-   **Complexity**: IoC can add complexity to applications, particularly for those new to the concept.
-   **Learning Curve**: There is a learning curve associated with understanding and using IoC frameworks effectively.
